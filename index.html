		Welcome. This website serves as a showcase of my professional skills and accomplishments as well as a space for me to write about my own interests and document projects I am working on. As you can see, I am not a web developer. I'm also not a data scientist, a programmer, a mathematician or an astronomer, but if you are any of those four things, you may well find something here that is relevant to your interests.
