		<br>
			<font face="monospace" size="5" color="#BABDB6">
				Collected thousands of posts from <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit's</a> Space and Astronomy boards, then trained a classification model to determine which of the two boards each post came from. Found which words were most important for classification and used these to make recommendations on how to improve amateur astronomy associations' public outreach programs.

		<a href="https://github.com/mjdaugherty/client_project">Optimizing Evacuation Routes During a Natural Disaster</a>
		<br>
			<font face="monospace" size="5" color="#BABDB6">
				Working with two teammates, <a href="https://github.com/SongMay717">Song May</a> and <a href="https://github.com/KellySlatery/">Kelly Slatery</a>, used tweets from police departments and transit authorities across Texas to train a model to find those that had to do with road closures and blockages, then extracted locations from those tweets and placed them on a map. Presented our results to representatives from FEMA.

		<a href="https://github.com/mjdaugherty/capstone_4">Predicting Galactic Redshifts from Magnitude Measurements</a>
		<br>
			<font face="monospace" size="5" color="#BABDB6">
				Gathered apparent magnitudue and redshift measurements for 100,000 galaxies, then used these to evaluate five regression models, ultimately choosing a random forest regression, to predict redshifts from magnitude measurements on unseen galaxies.
