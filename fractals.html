	        These are a few images I've generated with a program I wrote for exploring the Mandelbrot set. The source code may eventually go on my GitHub, but it is still <i>very</i> much a work in progress and I'd like to work on it some more before putting it out there. It's a simple program written in C++ using the SDL2 library; it's been done many times before, but this is my own implementation which I wrote from scratch, and I'm proud of it.
