			Exploratory data analysis, often referred to simply as EDA, is one of the most important parts of any data science project, and in my opinion it is also one of the most fun. EDA is where our creativity comes into play: we familiarize ourselves with the data and come up with interesting questions in the process. We often discover things we did not expect. We have to write a lot of code and do a lot of Googling. In this post, I will attempt to outline the first few steps of the data science workflow, starting with a blank text editor and ending with a few questions and possible answers.
